# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The objective of this project was to create a NotePad/To do list applying the CRUD concepts i've learned in the past projects + the MVCS concepts on the backend, i used MongoDB for the DB, i think i did pretty well for my first project with React! 

You can check this project out on Heroku:https://frontendnotepadblue.herokuapp.com/
